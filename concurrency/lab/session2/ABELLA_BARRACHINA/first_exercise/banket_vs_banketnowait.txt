Banket vs BanketNoWait

The Banket implementation uses Java's thread's capabilities.
Under the hood, it relies on some mechanism to prevent wasting cpu time.
Probably through hardware interruption or a clever run-time system.

This is a better implementation, as blocked processes/threads can be properly scheduled by the operative system giving the round-robin time slot to a non-blocked process/thread. The other implementation is not recommended.
