Exercise 1


=======================


MICROWAVE = (put_food_in -> SETTINGS),
SETTINGS = (set_heat_level -> set_time -> COOK |set_time -> set_heat_level -> COOK),
COOK = (cook -> take_food_out -> MICROWAVE).


Model the MICROWAVE example from above, this time using parallel composition.

Hint: You will need to use handshaking with shared actions, so that it is not possible
to produce silly action traces. eg to cook after take food out. 

There are
many ways of doing this, you may want to use the following three processes: COOK,
SET HEAT and SET TIME.)

Answer:

COOK = ( put_food_in -> cook -> take_food_out -> COOK).
SET_HEAT = ( put_food_in -> set_heat_level -> cook -> SET_HEAT).
SET_TIME = ( put_food_in -> set_time -> cook -> SET_TIME).
||MICROWAVE = ( COOK||SET_HEAT||SET_TIME).

The processes SET HEAT and SET TIME require the action put food in so that
they handshake with the MICROWAVE process, and are not allowed to just randomly
interleave. The MICROWAVE process cannot cook until both the actions
set heat level and set time have occurred, this is achieved by the shared cook
action.
