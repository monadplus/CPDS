A lift has a maximum capacity of N people. In a model of the lift control system,
passengers entering the lift are signalled by an enter action and passengers leaving
the lift are signalled by an exit action. Specify a safety property in FSP, which
when composed with the lift model, will check that the system never allows the lift
that it controls to have more than N occupants.
Answer:


const N = 10
property LIFTCAPACITY = LIFT[0],
LIFT[i:0..N-1] = (enter -> LIFT[i+1]
|when(i>0) exit -> LIFT[i-1]
|when(i==0)exit -> LIFT[0]
).


When N= 2 the LTS is:
