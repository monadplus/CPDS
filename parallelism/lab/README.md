# CPDS: Parallelism

The original tasks can be found at `./tasks.zip`

The solution of each part 

- Part 2 (openMP): `openmp/`
- Part 3 (MPI): `mpi/`
- Part 4 (CUDA):`cuda/`

## Implementation

### openMP

The main code is in `solver-omp.c`.

There is tool for plotting the output at `plot/`

Run the code: `./submit-omp.sh`

### MPI

### CUDA
